# Prolog

## Summary

+ Prolog is a language that is useful for doing symbolic and logic-based computation.
+ It‟s declarative: very different from imperative style programming like Java, C++, Python,…
+ A program is partly like a database but much more powerful since we can also have general
rules to infer new facts!
+ A Prolog interpreter can follow these facts/rules and answer queries by sophisticated search
